title: "About Me"
---

I am an Economics PhD student at George Mason University. I received my Bachelors in Economics from GMU in 2019 and my Masters in 2021. <!-- [\*]{.aside} -->

My research interests include political and applied microeconomics, historical political economy, growth, and institutional change. Of particular focus are periods of conflict and how individual behavior is shaped by those conditions. I work primarily in R, and have experience with geospatial analysis, text-as-data methods, and historical data digitization. I have taught undergraduate courses as a graduate lecturer at George Mason University, including microeconomics, macroeconomics, and development.
