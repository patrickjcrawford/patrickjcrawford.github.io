I received my Bachelors in Economics from GMU in 2019 and my Masters in 2021.\nMy research interests include political and applied microeconomics, historical political economy, growth, and institutional change. Of particular focus are periods of conflict and how individual behavior is shaped by those conditions. I am also interested in geospatial methods and applied econometrics.
